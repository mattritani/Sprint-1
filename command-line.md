What is the the command line?

The command line is almost like the background/ under the hood of the computer. Most of the computer that we engage with has other apps that make it more easier to engage with but the command line is doing the doing of it. So for instance we can just right-click and make a folder but the Terminal command line has a specific text command that will execute this also. So it's kind of like an engine.

 List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do.

 1. Touch

This command creates new files

 2. ls

 This command creates a list of files in whatever section of the computer you are in. So if you were in the desktop and typed 'ls' it would list all the files and folders that are on the desktop

 3. pwd

 This stands for 'print working directory' this shows where in the computer you are so it might be username/Documents/Holiday Photos - so this tells you where you are from the terminal which you can't really tell just by looking

 4. open

 You can use this command followed by the file name of a file in the directory that you want to open. Note that it will open in the native format of this file.

 5. cd/:

 call directory - you can use this command to navigate through the directory. So you could use the command pwd and then select the next folder or directory that you are after and then select that directory by going cd/:directoryname - it would be good to use the pwd command to check that you are in the right place

 6. clear

 If the terminal is looking messy/ you've done the commands that you want to you can use 'clear' to clear the command line and return to an empty screen

 7. mkdir [filename]

 mkdir will make a new directory - so similar to touch but it makes folders instead

 8. rm

 rm is remove - put the filename afterwards and it will delete this item from the directory - make sure that you are in the right place though

 9. pbcopy < [file-name]

 copy file - this is similar to a normal ctrl+v select the file in the directory and this will copy it to the clipboard

 10. pbpaste

 paste file. if the file is on the clipboard then it can be pasted into a new location
